        <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          Most public education focuses on top-down curriculum â€” especially
          lectures and assessments. For some people, the structure and stability
          of public education works well. But for few people, the pattern of
          "memorize-regurgitate-repeat" is boring and de-motivating.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other end of the spectrum, self-taught learners are often
          highly driven, because they've found a project or topic that deeply
          motivates them. But self-taught learning lack structure, so
          self-taught learners often get stuck and find themselves wondering,
          "What should I learn next?" or "Is this what I need to be learning to
          achieve my goal?"
        </p>
